    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
        Hi, I’m Pradipt — someone who loves exploring the cultural, historic, and spiritual heart of India. 
        This blog is where I document my journeys and share the moments, thoughts, and experiences that make travelling meaningful to me.
    </p>

    <p>
        I’ve visited places such as Ayodhya, the vibrant Mahakumbh, the divine Kamakhya Mandir in the Northeast, 
        Tirupati Balaji in the South, and the sacred Jagannath Temple in Puri. Each destination has offered a new perspective 
        on traditions, people, and the incredible diversity of our country.

        My posts aren’t formal travel guides — they are simple notes, personal observations, and memories from the road. 
        If you enjoy peaceful journeys, temple visits, cultural exploration, and discovering India through real experiences, 
        you’ll feel connected here.

        Thanks for stopping by — I hope my travel stories inspire your own future journeys.
